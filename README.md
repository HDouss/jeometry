jeometry is a Java geometric figures construction library.
It provides a simple API to:
* Build a geometric figure based on renderable shapes and relations between these shapes
* Output the figure to the screen

jeometry is easily extensible for a developer who wants to enhance the library with custom shapes, as well as to add more geometric figure output medium (for example: svg file, but there is no limit to imagination)

#Quick start
Before digging into technical details, let's begin with a quick start to clarify what could jeometry be for.
